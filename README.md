# Tetris
This is my version of Tetris made in Java.

You can download it and modify it as you want. If you want to add more pieces to the game, there are instructions at the top of the Tetromino.java

By the time I'm uploading the code the game is NOT complete.

TODO <br />
~~Add key to drop directly a key to the bottom~~. <br />
~~Add key to change the tetromino and store it for later~~.<br />
~~Make the player loose when he/she reaches the top of the board with a piece~~.<br />
Make the tetromino shadow to see where it is going to fall. <br />
Add sounds. <br />
Add option to change the background.<br />
~~Main menu~~, ~~game screen~~, top scores screen, options screen.<br />
